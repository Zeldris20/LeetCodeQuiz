# LeetCodeQuiz
This project was one of the hardest ones Ive ever made, I had to create alot of windows and navigating to each window was very confusing and figuring out which worked took most of the time in this project
I learnt how to navigate to different windows in WPF and Store data from one xaml file and be able to send that data to another file, it was a good challenge and im glad I was able to complete it, theres issues with it like 
saving the score in the highscore, I havent figured out how or making the wrong answer remove points, that confuses me alot, I would need to create an interger for score and somehow make the textbox the value of that interger
which I have 0 clue on how to do that, but as my first attempt its not bad!
